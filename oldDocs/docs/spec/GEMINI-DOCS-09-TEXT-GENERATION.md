# Text generation

The Gemini API can generate text output from various inputs, including text, images, video, and audio, leveraging Gemini models.

Here's a basic example that takes a single text input:

```bash
curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=$GEMINI_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "contents": [
      {
        "parts": [
          {
            "text": "How does AI work?"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## System instructions and configurations

You can guide the behavior of Gemini models with system instructions. To do so, pass a `GenerateContentConfig` object.

```bash
curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=$GEMINI_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "system_instruction": {
      "parts": [
        {
          "text": "You are a cat. Your name is Neko."
        }
      ]
    },
    "contents": [
      {
        "parts": [
          {
            "text": "Hello there"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

The `GenerateContentConfig` object also lets you override default generation parameters, such as `temperature`.

```bash
curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=$GEMINI_API_KEY \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "contents": [
      {
        "parts": [
          {
            "text": "Explain how AI works"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "generationConfig": {
      "stopSequences": [
        "Title"
      ],
      "temperature": 1.0,
      "maxOutputTokens": 800,
      "topP": 0.8,
      "topK": 10
    }
  }'
```

Refer to the `GenerateContentConfig` in our API reference for a complete list of configurable parameters and their descriptions.

## Multimodal inputs

The Gemini API supports multimodal inputs, allowing you to combine text with media files. The following example demonstrates providing an image:

```bash
# Use a temporary file to hold the base64 encoded image data
TEMP_B64=$(mktemp)
trap 'rm -f "$TEMP_B64"' EXIT

base64 $B64FLAGS $IMG_PATH > "$TEMP_B64"

# Use a temporary file to hold the JSON payload
TEMP_JSON=$(mktemp)
trap 'rm -f "$TEMP_JSON"' EXIT

cat > "$TEMP_JSON" << EOF
{
  "contents": [
    {
      "parts": [
        {
          "text": "Tell me about this instrument"
        },
        {
          "inline_data": {
            "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
            "data": "$(cat "$TEMP_B64")"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
EOF

curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=$GEMINI_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X POST \
  -d "@$TEMP_JSON"
```

For alternative methods of providing images and more advanced image processing, see our image understanding guide. The API also supports document, video, and audio inputs and understanding.

## Streaming responses

By default, the model returns a response only after the entire generation process is complete.

For more fluid interactions, use streaming to receive `GenerateContentResponse` instances incrementally as they're generated.

```bash
curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse&key=${GEMINI_API_KEY}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --no-buffer \
  -d '{
    "contents": [
      {
        "parts": [
          {
            "text": "Explain how AI works"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Multi-turn conversations (Chat)

Our SDKs provide functionality to collect multiple rounds of prompts and responses into a chat, giving you an easy way to keep track of the conversation history.

Note: Chat functionality is only implemented as part of the SDKs. Behind the scenes, it still uses the `generateContent` API.

```bash
curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=$GEMINI_API_KEY \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "contents": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [
          {
            "text": "Hello"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "role": "model",
        "parts": [
          {
            "text": "Great to meet you. What would you like to know?"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [
          {
            "text": "I have two dogs in my house. How many paws are in my house?"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Streaming can also be used for multi-turn conversations.

```bash
curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse&key=$GEMINI_API_KEY \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "contents": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [
          {
            "text": "Hello"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "role": "model",
        "parts": [
          {
            "text": "Great to meet you. What would you like to know?"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [
          {
            "text": "I have two dogs in my house. How many paws are in my house?"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Supported models

All models in the Gemini family support text generation. To learn more about the models and their capabilities, visit the Models page.

## Best practices

### Prompting tips

For basic text generation, a zero-shot prompt often suffices without needing examples, system instructions or specific formatting.

For more tailored outputs:

  * Use System instructions to guide the model.
  * Provide few example inputs and outputs to guide the model. This is often referred to as few-shot prompting.
  * Consider fine-tuning for advanced use cases.

Consult our prompt engineering guide for more tips.

### Structured output

In some cases, you may need structured output, such as JSON. Refer to our structured output guide to learn how.
