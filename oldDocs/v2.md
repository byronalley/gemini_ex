# Quickstart: Generate text using the Vertex AI Gemini API

To see an example of getting started with Gemini, run the "Intro to Gemini 2.0 Flash" Jupyter notebook in one of the following environments:

[Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GoogleCloud/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/community/generative_ai/intro_gemini_2_0_flash.ipynb) | [Open in Colab Enterprise](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/colab/kernels/new?template=https://github.com/GoogleCloud/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/community/generative_ai/intro_gemini_2_0_flash.ipynb) | [Open in Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/user-managed/create?create_notebook_url=https://github.com/GoogleCloud/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/community/generative_ai/intro_gemini_2_0_flash.ipynb) | [View on GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloud/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/community/generative_ai/intro_gemini_2_0_flash.ipynb)

In this quickstart, you send the following multimodal requests to the **Vertex AI Gemini API** and view the responses:

* A text prompt
* A prompt and an image
* A prompt and a video file (with an audio track)

You can complete this quickstart by using a programming language SDK in your local environment or the REST API.

---

## Prerequisites

Completing this quickstart requires you to:

* Set up a **Google Cloud project** and enable the **Vertex AI API**.
* On your local machine:
    * Install, initialize, and authenticate with the **Google Cloud CLI**.
    * Install the SDK for your language.

---

## Set up a Google Cloud project

Set up your **Google Cloud project** and enable the **Vertex AI API**.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a **Google Cloud project**.

    **Note**: If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

    [Go to project selector](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector)

2.  Make sure that billing is enabled for your **Google Cloud project**.

3.  Enable the **Vertex AI API**.

    [Enable the API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com)

---

## Set up the Google Cloud CLI

On your local machine, set up and authenticate with the **Google Cloud CLI**. If you are familiar with the **Gemini API** in **Google AI Studio**, note that the **Vertex AI Gemini API** uses **Identity and Access Management** instead of API keys to manage access.

1.  [Install and initialize](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the **Google Cloud CLI**.

2.  If you previously installed the `gcloud CLI`, ensure your `gcloud` components are updated by running this command:

    ```bash
    gcloud components update
    ```

3.  To authenticate with the `gcloud CLI`, generate a local **Application Default Credentials (ADC)** file by running this command. The web flow launched by the command is used to provide your user credentials:

    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

    For more information, see [Set up Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc).

    **Note**: To avoid providing your project ID and region to the **Google Cloud CLI**, you can use the `gcloud config set` command to set a default project and region.

## Set up the SDK for your programming language

On your local machine, click one of the following tabs to install the SDK for your programming language:

* [Gen AI SDK for Python](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/sdk-overview#python)
* [Gen AI SDK for Go](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/sdk-overview#go)
* [Gen AI SDK for Node.js](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/sdk-overview#nodejs)
* [Gen AI SDK for Java](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/sdk-overview#java)
* [C#](https://cloud.google.com/dotnet/docs/reference/Google.Cloud.AIPlatform.V1/latest/overview)
* [REST](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/sdk-overview#rest)

Configure your environment variables by entering the following. Replace `PROJECT_ID` with the ID of your Google Cloud project:

```bash
MODEL_ID="gemini-2.0-flash-001"
PROJECT_ID="PROJECT_ID"
